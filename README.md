# Discord Dice Roller

This is a Discord bot for rolling dice. This was created as a simple project for a beginning school-age programmer.

## Using this seed

Fork this repo and start coding adding code to the `src/` directory.

## Developing

Develop and test the running application with `npm run watch` or `npm run watch:debug`

Run unit tests with `npm run test`

## Run your application

Build the app first with `npm run build`

Run the app with `npm start`

## Contributing

Feel free to add more sensible defaults for a basic node application, such as a "prettier" config, if that would
best, or a `npm run tdd` script for running tests in a watch mode.
